Description ‚ú® This project is an AI Chatbot. It uses a virtual environment to manage dependencies, connects to the OpenAI API for its core functionality, and is built using Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface. The project setup includes a .gitignore file to protect sensitive information like API keys, a .env file for environment variables, and a standard main.py file for the application's code.
Features ü§ñ Interactive Chat Interface: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
OpenAI Integration: Connects to the OpenAI API to generate responses.
Dependency Management: Uses a virtual environment to keep project dependencies organized and isolated.
Secure API Key Handling: Utilizes a .env file to securely store the API key, which is ignored by Git.
